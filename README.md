> Note: RookDB currently supports only INT and TEXT data types. Ensure that table schemas are created using only these data types. Accordingly, the CSV file used for loading data (e.g., examples/example.csv) must contain only INT or TEXT columns. If you are running the system for the first time, it is recommended to load examples/example.csv to understand the expected format.
